    <h1>6/9 Update:</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of the global health crisis, the Arizona Board of Massage Therapy and Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals (the professional organization to which I belong) recommended that all therapists suspend operations for at least 4 weeks.</p>
    <p>I believe it is in the best interest and health of my Clients, their families and myself and my family to remain closed through <strong>July 1</strong>.</p>
    <p>I hope each of you is taking the precautions that are suggested and that you stay well.  I look forward to seeing you on the other side of this challenge.  I am working on additional appropriate safety measures to protect both my valued clients and myself so I am prepared to safely provide services when I reopen.</p>
